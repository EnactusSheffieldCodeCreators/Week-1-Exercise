# Week-1-Exercise

## Introduction

This git repository has a file called `solution.py` which contains some absolutely terrible code to solve the 3rd problem on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3). Read through that exercise and then take your time to study the code. It's deliberately very obtuse because that's what working with other people's code is going to be like.

## The Exercise

Your job this week is to explore python and make sure you have it set up correctly. If you managed to clone the git repository then you already have that installed. Make sure that you can run the file in your environment before proceeding. If you have any problems please contact us on the discord.

## Optional Fun-times

If you have the file running and you don't need no stinking setup guide for python then here's the optional challenge. Fix the code.

Copy the code to another file (outside the repository) and clean up all the untidy and bad bits of the code. Give your best shot at it and then when you think you're done hop over to the solutions branch using the command `git checkout solutions` and the solution.py will now be magically fixed.

## Final Note

Best of luck, don't worry too much about the optional part, the important bit this week is making sure that you have the python and git set up for the rest of the course.
